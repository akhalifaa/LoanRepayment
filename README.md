# LoanRepayment
# Project Overview:
* A comprehensive project involving heavy feature engineering to create a NN model that classifies whether an individual will repay a loan or not.
* Analyzed plenty of features such as total credit accounts, job title, loan grade, mortgage accounts and many more in order to prepare the data for training.
* Feature engineering involved looking at categorical features and their correlations to numerical features in order to transform them into trainable data.
* Utilized dummy features, mapping and function applying to certain features in order to transform them into trainable data.
* Created a fully connected Neural Network using Keras that took in 78 features, involved two hidden layers and an output layer that classifies whether a certain individual would repay their loan or not.
* Evaluate model metrics: achieved a good model training and validating loss and classification report/confusion matrix convey 90% accuracy. This can be much improved if we use the full data set and increase training epochs.
